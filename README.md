### Brief History
-----
New Light has been a journey, starting with a small knowledge HTML and an even smaller pool of javascript, research was done and Python proved to be the easiest to start on, learning while developing has been a great experience, I have learned more by doing random stuff and hoping it owkrs then by goign through learner courses. I started in the spring of '22, after a few years of seeing bots and wanting to create one I finally had access to the programs to do it. I took inspiration from a game I play, Deep Space Airships (drednot.io). Starting from a basic battle loot to parsing web files and extensive databaseing.
