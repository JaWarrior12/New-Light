### Brief History
-----
New Light has been a journey, starting with a small knowledge HTML and an even smaller pool of javascript, research was done and Python proved to be the easiest to start on, learning while developing has been a great experience, I have learned more by doing random stuff and hoping it owkrs then by goign through learner courses. I started in the spring of '22, after a few years of seeing bots and wanting to create one I finally had access to the programs to do it. I took inspiration from a game I play, Dredark.io. Seeing the in-game clans I wanted a clan and a way to manage relations and loot distribution. The first thing added to New Light was a minimal distribution setup, I could only read the JSON file. Later the ability to change balances was added. I learned calling and changing JSON values. The early addition command was, addition only, so you would have to manually change to subtract. After some more time I added subtraction andthe ability to add members. Removing them was a struggle at the time.
